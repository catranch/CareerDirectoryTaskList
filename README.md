In development - helpful list for finding resources at a ocal university

This Task List is designed to help people choose a career. It is a mobile app that will run on iOS 9.
It uses the mobile app project called Homepwner (not a typo, but yes, it is a play on Homeowner 
and it was designed to take an inventory of item in a home) that is the work of Big Nerd Ranch.
Giving credit where it is due - the iOS Programming book by Big Nerd Ranch has better explanations than most books in that genre.
