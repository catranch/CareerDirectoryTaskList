This Task List is designed to help people choose a career. It is a mobile app that will run on iOS 9.
It uses the mobile app project called Homepwner (not a typo, but yes, it is a play on Homeowner 
and it was designed to take an inventory of item in a home) that is the work of Big Nerd Ranch.
Giving credit where it is due - the iOS Programming book is one of the best ones I've read so far.
